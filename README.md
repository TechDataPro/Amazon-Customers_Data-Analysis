# Amazon-Customers_Data-Analysis

To connect the analysis to my SQLite file, I established a connection and retrieved the necessary data for further examination. Once connected, I performed Sentiment Analysis on the data to understand the sentiments expressed in the text comments.
Next, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) specifically for positive sentences. By exploring the positive sentiment comments, I gained insights into the common themes, 

positive experiences, and sentiments expressed by customers.
Similarly, I performed an EDA for negative sentences to understand the issues, concerns, and negative experiences shared by customers in their comments.

Moving forward, I analyzed to which users Amazon recommended products more. By examining the data, I identified the users who received the highest number of product recommendations from Amazon, indicating their likelihood of making future purchases.
Additionally, I identified the top 10 highest potential customers who were most likely to buy more from Amazon again. 

This analysis helped me identify the most valuable customers and tailor marketing strategies to retain their loyalty.
Furthermore, I analyzed the length of comments to determine whether customers tended to give lengthy or short comments. By examining the data, 

I gained insights into the average length of comments and the distribution of comment lengths.
As the dataset was large, I created a sample of a certain amount of data for this analysis. This allowed me to efficiently analyze the data while still capturing its essence.

Next, I applied a function to my text column to further process and prepare the data for analysis.
Lastly, I analyzed the scores of the comments. By examining the score distribution,
I gained an understanding of the overall sentiment polarity and the distribution of positive and negative sentiments in the comments.
